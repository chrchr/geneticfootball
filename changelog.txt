changelog

04/28/2015
- added secret experimental handoff code; off by default, but can be enabled at the JS console by assigning handoffs_permitted = true.  Ball carrier will hand the ball forward to a friendly player they come in contact with if that player is closer to goal than they are.

04/26/2015
- added historical game-by-game scorekeeping (.history) and cumulative all-games-played totals (.career) to team and player objects, to make it possible to do more detailed tracking of statistics over time.

04/23/2015
- partial fix to IE11 problem; game will now run for anyone stuck with this browser, but control sliders need to be changed once after page load to actually correctly provide the game with a value.

04/22/2015
- major feature addition: 1-player leagues now use singular version of team names, e.g. Dove vs. Penguin instead of Doves/Penguins

04/21/2015
- initial public release, everything is probably perfect forever
